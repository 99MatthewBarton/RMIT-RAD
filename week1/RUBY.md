### Lexical conventions for ruby
- white space
    - Whitespace characters such as spaces and tabs are generally ignore in  Ruby code, except when they appear in strings
- line ending
    - interprets semicolons and newline characters as the ending of a statement
    - However, if Ruby encounters operators, such as `+`, `-` , or backslash at the end of a line, they indicate the continuation of a statement.
   - e.g. ruby `a = (4 // break here + 5)`
- Comments
    - `#`
    - `=begin //break here ... =end`
- Identifiers
    - names of variables, constants, and methods
    - distinguish a variableâ€™s type by the initial character of its identifier
